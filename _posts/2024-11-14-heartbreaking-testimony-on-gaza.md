When my first son was born, I was most surprised by the fear.

I had a lot of strong emotions that first day. The initial relief that my wife and
son were ok, the amazement that I had contributed to a miracle, and our shared
anxiety about driving home. But what hit me strongest was the fear that the
world would hurt him, and how I wouldn't be able to protect him forever.

It shaped my thinking about fatherhood. I know my job is to provide an
environment for his growth, and to prepare him for the world. Sometimes
I think I'm sheltering him too much, and sometimes not enough. He's a smart
kid, and he's got a very good sense of right and wrong.

I recently watched [this](/assets/transcript.txt) and made this:
