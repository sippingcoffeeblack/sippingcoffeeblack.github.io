So I got interested in writing a blog again.

I really hate putting ads on my writing, so I decided to
host with Jekyll on GitHub pages. Using the Chirpy theme, which is nice so far.

Here's some code, for fun:

```sh
#/usr/bin/env bash

echo "That was interesting."
```

And here's a quote:

Lists are useful, too:

* I would walk
* ten thousand miles
* and fall down at your door

A line for good measure.

Ok, bye.
