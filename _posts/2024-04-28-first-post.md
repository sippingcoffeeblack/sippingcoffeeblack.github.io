I like to write. But I hate the idea of using [Medium](https://medium.com/), or any
other publishing platform that makes writing inaccessible through reader-hostile
practices like email harvesting, tracking, and excessive ads.

Now, I'm all for paying to publish, but these days when I see a Medium article I
tend to avoid it.

So I decided, as long as GitHub is offering free static website hosting for nerds,
I'll use it.

For now I'm using the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is reasonably well documented and easy enough
to understand. Props to the team for that.

I've considered using Jekyll or another static site generator in the past, but
avoided Jekyll specifically because I can't stand the Ruby ecosystem, and static site
generators because they're all over the map.

But Jekyll seems to have some staying power. And Chirpy's developers seem to have
partially good taste.

So here I am.
