I like to write. But I hate the idea of using [Medium](https://medium.com/), or any
other publishing platform designed to meter and charge readers for usage.

I don't mind paying a little to make my writing publicly readable without associating
it with junk. But last time I tried, I felt obligated _because_ I was paying. It
changed dynamic, so I got bored with it and quit.

So I decided, as long as GitHub is offering free static website hosting for nerds,
I'll use it. I think we're a good decade away from the enshittification of GitHub,
at which time I can take my toys and leave.

Anyway, for now I'm using the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is reasonably well documented and easy enough
to understand. Props to the team for that.

I've considered using Jekyll or another static site generator in the past, but
avoided Jekyll specifically because I can't stand the Ruby ecosystem, and static site
generators because they're all over the map.

But Jekyll seems to have some staying power. And Chirpy's developers seem to have
partially good taste.

So, here I am.
