In the hush of night, where whispers dwell,<br/>
A solitary cup casts an ancient spell.<br/>
Through veils of mist where truths entwine,<br/>
Glimmer hints of crimson, ebony, and pine.<br/>
<br/>
Amid the silence, dreams unfurl their wings,<br/>
A cryptic dance of unseen, vibrant things,<br/>
Each shade a story, bold yet unseen,<br/>
Hidden within the palette of a dream.<br/>
